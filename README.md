- 👋 Hi, I’m @ajaymatthieu
- 👀 I’m interested in workflow automation for regressive work at tech, automation testing of web apps and cross browser testing, Java and web hosting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning single board computers like the Raspberry Pi and working on projects with that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and anywhere I can work on, especially open source pieces.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email works best! ajaymatthieu.codes@gmail.com is the way to go.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: Love coding when I am into the piece of work, hate it when someone is breathing down my neck about it.
